iCar
====
This was a short project to experiment with the PSoC 4 BLE module and iOS app
development. The mechanical structure of the car is a little hacky -- it was
constructed with material found around the house. 

The project organization is as follows:
+ Cypress_PSoC:: PSoC Creator project
+ hbridge_schematic:: EAGLE schematic of the hbridge
+ iCar/iCar.xcodeproj:: Xcode project for the iOS app
+ media:: images, videos, and pdfs of the designs and results
